    <h6>About Me</h6>
    <p>Hi! I&apos;m a Full-Stack JavaScript developer living in Portland, OR. I have great passion for collaborating on teams in the pursuit of the realization of people&apos;s visions of their product, from wire-framing to final deployment.</p>
    <p>I grew up in a tree-house along the Suwannee River in Florida, around artists and creative thinkers, so I bring a unique and creative background to the table. I love using my tech and people skills to help others and I pride myself on being a strong teammate.</p>
    <p>Before becoming a developer, I was a professional recording engineer since 2007. A particular highlight for me was engineering and mixing a song on a Grammy nominated album! Since then I&apos;ve discovered web development and immersed myself in this interesting and always evolving world.</p>
    <p>Its exciting to contribute my skills to helping people bring their ideas to fruition. I have a huge passion for using tech to improve our world and our lives. Music is always a huge part of my life too. As a developer, I love getting involved with projects that touch on these areas as much as I can! </p>
    <p>My biggest motivation as a developer is to collaborate with others in the creation of apps that impact our world and our lives in positive ways.</p>
