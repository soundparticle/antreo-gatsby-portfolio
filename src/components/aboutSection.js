  <h6>About Me</h6>
  <p>I'm a Full-Stack JavaScript developer based in Portland, OR who
  is passionate about collaboration and working together to realize people's vision of their product. I love using my tech and people skills to help others and positively impact our world.</p>
  <p>Besides being a developer, I've been a recording engineer since 2007. One highlight was engineering and mixing a song on a Grammy nominated album. Since then I've shifted towards web-development and contributing my skills to help create things that improve our world. As a developer, I love getting involved with projects that touch on these areas when I can!</p>
  
  <p>I grew up in a treehouse along the Suwannee River in Florida, around artists and creative thinkers.</p>
  <p>I seek to work together with others to create things that move and impact people in positive ways.</p>
