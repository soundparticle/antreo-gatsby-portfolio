  <h4>About Me</h4>
  <p>I'm originally from Florida where I grew up in a treehouse along the Suwannee River. I moved west after I finished high school. I graduated from The Evergreen State College in Washington with a BA in Sound Engineering. I've been a freelance recording engineer in Portland, OR since 2007. Highlights included engineering and mixing a song on a Grammy nominated album. Since then I've sought a more stable career field that is still interesting and rewarding. Having many friends involved in the tech field as developers, I discovered web development as the perfect career choice!</p>
  <p>I completed this transition after completing the career track at The Alchemy Code Lab which involved 800+ hours of intensive learning and I'm now a skilled full-stack web developer!</p>

  <p>I love being involved in the front-end side of development and working with others as a team. Work which impacts the world positively is something I'm always looking out for. I seek to use my tech and people skills in combination with others to create things that move and impact people.
  I'm a musician and experienced recording/mixing/mastering engineer on the side as well, and as a developer, I love getting involved with projects that touch on these fields! I also offer a unique and valuable mix of skills that I bring to any team I'm part of.</p>
