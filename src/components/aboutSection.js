  <h4>About Me</h4>
  <p>I grew up in a treehouse along the Suwannee River in Florida, around artists and creative thinkers. I enjoy and thrive working collaboratively with others. Besides being a developer, I've been a recording engineer in Portland, OR since 2007. One highlight was engineering and mixing a song on a Grammy nominated album. Since then I've shifted towards web-development and contributing my skills to help create cool new things!</p>
  <p>Recently, I've refined and evolved my skills after completing the full career track at The Alchemy Code Lab, which involved 800+ hours of intensive learning.</p>

  <p>I love being involved in the front-end side of development and collaborating with others as a team. I seek to work together with others to create things that move and impact people in positive ways.
  I'm a musician and experienced recording/mixing/mastering engineer on the side as well, and as a developer, I love getting involved with projects that touch on both these fields!</p>
