    <h6>About Me</h6>
    <p>I&apos;m a Full-Stack JavaScript developer based in Portland, OR who is passionate about collaboration and working together to realize people&apos;s vision of their product.</p>
    <p>I grew up in a tree-house along the Suwannee River in Florida, around artists and creative thinkers, so I bring a unique background to the table. I love using my tech and people skills to help others and positively impact our world.</p>
    <p>Besides being a developer, I&apos;ve been a recording engineer since 2007. A particular highlight for me was engineering and mixing a song on a Grammy nominated album. Since then I&apos;ve shifted towards web-development and contributing my skills to helping create things that improve our world. As a developer, I love getting involved with projects that touch on these areas when I can! My biggest passion and motivation is to work collaboratively with others to create things which move people and impact our world in positive ways.</p>
